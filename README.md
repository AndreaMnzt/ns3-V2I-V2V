# Integration of Mmwave and Millicar modules #

This is an [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org "ns-3 Website") module for the simulation
of 5G cellular and vehicular networks operating at mmWaves.

Features:

* The module provides integration of mmwave and millicar modules to simulate vehicular scenarios with Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication.
  
## Installation
This repository contains a complete ns-3 installation with the addition of the mmwave and millicar modules. 

Use these commands to download and build `ns3-V2I-V2V`:
```
git clone https://github.com/AndreaMnzt/ns3-V2I-V2V.git
cd ns3-V2I-V2V
./waf configure --disable-python --enable-examples && ./waf build
```

## Usage example 
You can use the following command to run the `mmwave-simple-epc` example. 
```
./waf --run mmwave-simple-epc
```
Other examples are included in `src/mmwave/examples/`
